I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisor, Professor Feifei Qian, and my Ph.D. student mentor, Shipeng Liu, for their exceptional mentorship, intellectual guidance, and unwavering support throughout the course of this research.

This work would not have been possible without the support of the RoboLAND Lab at the University of Southern California, whose resources and collaborative environment were instrumental to the development and validation of this work.

I also wish to acknowledge the LASSIE project team for their vision in shaping the broader context of this research, and for providing an ambitious platform that inspired the pursuit of safe, proprioceptive navigation for planetary environments.

Lastly, I extend heartfelt appreciation to my family and friends for their camaraderie, encouragement, and grounding presence. Your support helped sustain the energy and purpose that brought this thesis to completion.
